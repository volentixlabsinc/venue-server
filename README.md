## Usage

### Running

Note that at the time of writting, the app does not have a set up for local development other than the docker compose script. Future iterations are expected to provide this capability.

To run the application:
```
docker-compose up
```

To recreate the docker containers from scratch and clean out the database:
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose build web
docker-compose up
```

Test the app:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/retrieve/leaderboard-data/
```

Login to the admin:
  * **User:** admin
  * **Password:** default2018
```
http://localhost:8000/admin
```

See the API docs and interactive explorer:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs/
```

### Testing
